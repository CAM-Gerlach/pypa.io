PyPA Members, And How To Join
=============================

:Last Reviewed: 2020-06-08

Historically, the PyPA has been a loose confederation of people
and projects; the word "authority" in the name was meant to be
a joke.

.. _`Does not require membership`:

Does not require membership
---------------------------

Anyone is welcome to (while following licensing terms) use PyPA projects.

Anyone is welcome to (while following the PyPA's :ref:`Code of Conduct`)
contribute patches, bug reports, feature requests, ideas, questions,
answers, and similar information in our `GitHub organization`_ and
`Bitbucket organization`_ repositories, and discuss issues and plans
with us in `the Packaging category on discuss.python.org`_ and on `the
distutils-sig mailing list`_.

.. _`Project membership`:

Project membership
------------------

The PyPA member projects are those listed within our `GitHub organization
<https://github.com/pypa>`_ and `Bitbucket organization
<https://bitbucket.org/pypa>`_.

We currently do not have a codified process for inviting or accepting
projects to be PyPA members. :pep:`609` is currently under discussion
to formalize the process.

In the interim, to request PyPA project membership, start a thread on
`the Packaging category on discuss.python.org`_ or on `the
distutils-sig mailing list`_ requesting PyPA project
membership. Criteria include the project adopting the PyPA's
:ref:`Code of Conduct` and the project being relevant to Python
packaging, as determined by existing members of PyPA. The decision
will rest with the PyPA organizational administrators on GitHub or
Bitbucket.

.. _`Individual membership`:

Individual membership
---------------------

Maintainership of a project that is under the PyPA organization
automatically transfers individual membership in the PyPA. The PyPA
individual members are those who have maintainer status (also known as
committer status or write permissions) on any projects within the PyPA
`GitHub organization <https://github.com/pypa>`_ or `Bitbucket
organization <https://bitbucket.org/pypa>`_. Currently there is no
public list of all PyPA individual members.

The PyPA currently does not have a codified process for inviting or
accepting individuals to be PyPA members.

To become an individual member of the PyPA, you can do either of the following:

1. attain PyPA project membership for your project (for which you are already a maintainer)
2. attain maintainership in a project that is already a PyPA member project

PyPA member projects each make their own decisions regarding granting
maintainer rights.  :pep:`609`, if accepted, would not alter this.
