.. _`PyPA Specifications`:

===================
PyPA Specifications
===================

In addition to maintaining the default implementation of the Python packaging
toolchain, the Python Packaging Authority is also responsible for maintaining
the interoperability specifications used to define the interactions between
those tools.

Active Specifications
---------------------

Interoperability specifications maintained by the Python Packaging Authority
are tracked as Informational Python Enhancement Proposals in accordance
with :pep:`1`.

The currently active specifications are recorded in the
:ref:`PyPA Specifications <pypug:specifications>` section of the
Python Packaging User Guide.

This section may also include clarifications, amendments and additional
guidance for specification implementors in cases where the corresponding
PEPs have yet to be updated appropriately.


Specification Update Process
----------------------------

PyPA interoperability specifications are separated into two categories:

* `Package Distribution Metadata <https://packaging.python.org/specifications/`_
* `Package Index Interfaces <https://packaging.python.org/specifications/`_

For Package Distribution Metadata, the default responsible decision maker is
the lead CPython representative on distutils-sig.

The current lead CPython representative on distutils-sig is Nick Coghlan.

For Package Index Interfaces, the default responsible decision maker is
the lead maintainer for the `Python Package Index <https://pypi.org>`__.

The current lead PyPI maintainer is Donald Stufft.


Proposing new specifications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Proposals for new interoperability specifications should be formulated and
submitted as new Informational Python Enhancement Proposals in accordance
with :pep:`1`.

Such proposals must be accompanied by a PR against the PyPA Specifications
section in the Python Packaging User Guide that adds a new subsection defining
the purpose of the new specification and the role it plays in the wider Python
packaging ecosystem.

The ``Discussions-To`` header in packaging related PEPs should be set to
``distutils-sig@python.org``.

Whenever a new PEP is put forward on distutils-sig, any PyPA core
reviewer that believes they are suitably experienced to make the final
decision on that PEP may offer to serve as the BDFL's delegate (or
"PEP czar") for that PEP. If their self-nomination is accepted by the
other PyPA core reviewers, the lead PyPI maintainer and the lead
CPython representative on distutils-sig, then they will have the
authority to approve (or reject) that PEP.

Otherwise, the default BDFL-Delegate depends on the area the PEP affects:

* Package Distribution Metadata: lead CPython representative on distutils-sig
* Package Index Interfaces: lead PyPI maintainer

Provisional Acceptance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

PyPA has its own variant of the standard library's provisional modules, which
is provisional interoperability specifications.

These are specifications which have been accepted for implementation in the
core packaging tools (PyPI, pip, etc), but are still considered subject to
potentially backwards incompatible amendments if real world experience
indicates that there are critical problems in the interface design that make
it hard to implement and/or use correctly.

When a PEP has only been provisionally accepted, this will be noted in the
text of the affected PEP.

Handling fixes and other minor updates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The preferred approach to handling fixes and other minor updates adopted for
all recent interoperability specifications is to submit an issue and/or pull
request against the `official PEPs repo <https://github.com/python/peps>`_.

All enhancements proposed this way *must* be discussed on distutils-sig prior
to amending the PEP, and any changes made after PEP acceptance must be
explicitly documented in a "Changes" section in the PEP itself. For example,
see:

* `Changes in PEP 440 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/#summary-of-changes-to-pep-440>`_
* `Changes in PEP 503 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0503/#changes>`_

PyPA core reviewers that are also PEP editors are responsible for deciding which
of these changes can just be accepted (e.g. fixing a typo), which need to be
reviewed by the relevant responsible decision maker before being accepted, and
which need to be escalated to the full Python Enhancement Proposal process.

Current exceptions to this policy exist for:

* the core metadata specification in PEP 345
* the installed distributions metadata layout specification in PEP 376

For historical reasons, these PEPs are currently maintained in a hybrid
state where additional fields and the selective superceding of various
sections is documented directly in the specification section of the Python
Packaging User Guide rather than being incorporated into the original PEP.

.. With the definition and adoption of metadata 2.0 deferred indefinitely,
   the PyPUG changes to PEP 345 should probably be rolled into a metadata 1.3
   informational PEP that follows the standard update policy described above

   Similarly, a new PEP could describe the installation metadata as actually
   emitted by pip, rather than as originally proposed in PEP 376, without
   needing to add anything new to it


Handling major updates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For package distribution metadata, proposals that require backwards
incompatible changes to existing interoperability specifications for
package distribution metadata (and hence a new major version of the
specification rather than an in-place update) are currently not permitted.

This policy has been introduced based on historical experience that such
incompatibilities lead to the community sticking with older versions of the
metadata format indefinitely rather than upgrading to the revised format.

For package index interfaces, major updates are handled as either Process or
Standards Track PEPs targeting the Python Package Index as the reference
implementation. All such PEPs that introduce backwards incompatible changes
are required to define a suitable transition plan for affected software
publishers and tool developers.
